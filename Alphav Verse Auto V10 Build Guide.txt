00:00:05 finally guys girls ladies and gentlemen time is come long overdue this video
00:00:10 I've been trying to hold back as long as I possibly can I don't feel I can hold back anymore but this is going to be the
00:00:16 new alphav verse Auto V10 build guide okay we're going to be going right from
00:00:22 scratch today rest assure this video will be broken down into chapters and you're definitely going to have to come
00:00:28 back and revisit certain sections of this but I'm going to talk you through an entire setup from beginning to end on
00:00:34 alpe so but before we begin I am not going to discuss installation of Linux
00:00:40 or any nuances along that because it will vary from whatever provider you're going to be using and this really isn't
00:00:47 um a video about installing Linux but there are a couple of changes that I have done to this build to try to make
00:00:54 it a little bit easier for you so let me show you so I've done a little bit of prep preparation work before fore had
00:01:00 but before I come on to I want to show you I've been running now with three test accounts on new alav Auto where it
00:01:07 does automatic withdrawals and deposits to a centralized wallet address and no
00:01:12 longer does tipping works really well I've been running it for a few days I end out a number bugs and I think I've
00:01:18 done like nine updates and I've recently done an update in the last 20 minutes actually it's all looking good it's all
00:01:25 looking good I'm finally kind of happy with where the build is and the functionality
00:01:30 and despite that only showing there was one bust they actually all bust and I was just testing with 85 balance 644
00:01:40 recovery part which is in the Central Central wallet that's been shed across these and yeah it ran really well you
00:01:47 can see one this one here run a considerable number of bets right so prerequisites I'm going to
00:01:55 be asking you to install a buntu server and a buntu DE Des toop before we only
00:02:01 used to use a BTU server and there's been a couple of changes since 20204
00:02:07 yeah in the way that network network is being managed so I really want to make this quite simple and easy for you so
00:02:13 what I suggest is if you go to auntu go to the downloads page and get those isos
00:02:18 let me show you the page so when you go to abo.com you go/ download like I said put all these prerequisites in the
00:02:25 document so try to make it easy as possible for you so we're going to download the desktop and we just get the
00:02:31 latest one this this one here and for the server we're going to go do exactly the same we're going to get the latest
00:02:37 version of the server here and you're going to install those on the server you will see that I have allocated 8 GB of
00:02:45 RAM and four virtual CPUs and for storage I've allocated 100 GB I've done
00:02:51 just a vanilla install I've done nothing to it guys it's just got auntu installed the only things that I have done is I've
00:02:57 updated it to make sure that it's patched updated yeah it's fully up to dat and same for a
00:03:03 BTU desktop if I just show you that again it's a vanilla vanilla install and
00:03:08 when you do do the install you're going to make sure that you choose the minimum install and I just made a couple of
00:03:13 changes to this so I've I removed Firefox wasn't needed I installed
00:03:19 chromium instead of Firefox and the reason I installed chromium is because chromium will allow you to install
00:03:25 Chrome extensions and I put two Chrome extensions in here for Google
00:03:31 Authenticator which you may find useful later on because you may want to set this up with that particular stake
00:03:36 account and it's quite handy have an authenticator in there and I put Tron link as well and that is as far as I got
00:03:42 and the only other final thing that I have done that which is relevant to me because the hypervisor that I'm using is
00:03:49 Citrix Zen server I have have also installed the hypervisor integration
00:03:54 tools so basically I've got two vanilla installations
00:04:00 for the server I'm going to keep it as is we're going to that's the first one we're going to be working on but on the
00:04:05 client I'm quite happy with this build so what I'm going to do is shut this
00:04:10 down and I'm going to convert this to a template so when I convert that to a template that means I can use that to
00:04:16 deploy multiple clients but I'm just going to deploy one and we will end up deploying another template because I
00:04:22 just want to this is just a template for basically Linux this there's not
00:04:27 nothing's installed in it no alpe no nothing right I'm going to leave that channel away and we're going to come
00:04:33 over to my server build yeah and the first thing we're going to do we're going to get this server up and running
00:04:39 we're going to get this server up and running building a server is the
00:04:44 quickest and EAS easiest task out of all all of what we're about to do most of the work happens on the client and what
00:04:51 I do I keep a list of all of the commands and I make I'll put it in a PDF for you and I'll make it nice and easy
00:04:56 for you is just make sure the server is fully patched so I'm going to log in now for this purpose of this testing CU
00:05:02 these servers will be deleted so I'm going to share everything here so you can see exactly what I'm doing I don't
00:05:09 really want to blur anything out so the username and password for this setup is user and the password is password okay
00:05:16 and we're going to run we're going to run sudu a update we're just checking to
00:05:21 make sure there's no more updates right just to be sure I am going to reboot this okay rebooted it I've just run the
00:05:27 check can there's no more updates to be run on this particular machine so we've got those first two commands out of the
00:05:32 way and we have a a few tools to install one is net tools so we can run an if
00:05:38 config the other one is nodejs the other one is SSH pass which we're going to use and final one is JQ in fact we can put
00:05:44 those all in one command line so there we go we got sudu Amp Install net tools
00:05:51 nodejs SSH pass and JQ sorry well now
00:05:56 they're installed we're going to download and install MVM I switched over to putty guys
00:06:02 because yeah it's easy to work with now you have to log out and log back in I'll
00:06:08 put that in here and we need to run these two commands MVM install node and MVM use node let me do that right and
00:06:15 now we're ready to clone alphs right from here we just go into alphs Auto we
00:06:23 need to modify the Bim folder so that the they they're all executable so we
00:06:29 use chod for that so we add in chamod plus X and then it's [Music]
00:06:37 bin sh we would know if that worked if we did an LS under the Bim folder they
00:06:43 should have be green so that means they they're all executable well I preop I've
00:06:48 I pre-populated some of the things we need to do from here onwards so first we need to go into the F ofos Auto folder
00:06:55 and we are here and the first step we need to do is we need to remove the current package.json file because the
00:07:02 way that it's been set up on alphab is that there a package.json file for the client and there's a package Json file
00:07:08 for the F for the server so what we have to do is we basically have to remove the package.json file because that's for the
00:07:14 client and we have to rename the server package.json to package.json and then we
00:07:20 can go through these commands here so we're going to install the latest Network pack packet manager or no packet
00:07:26 manager sorry and we're also going to run a little tour that installs the it's an update check tool okay this gives us
00:07:34 the ability that we can now run a command called ncu so so it's Network package manager check update ncu dasu so
00:07:42 if there's any dependencies in your package.json file that need updating like they do near here this dashu
00:07:48 command does update them so we needed to run that it means when we run an mpm
00:07:53 install now these will be updated to the latest version okay we're going to do the sem just going an upgrad make sure
00:07:59 there's nothing needs doing right we're nearly there guys there's this one last command it's quite a long one this
00:08:05 command here this is used um for the get get IPS screen so when you if you're
00:08:12 using VPN you need we're using Puppeteer and Puppeteer uses a headerless version
00:08:18 of of the Chromium browser so we need to make sure it's got all the right libraries installed this took me a time
00:08:24 to work this out so you just got it as one command here pretty quick and what we're looking for for there's this extra
00:08:31 command here what we're looking for is to make sure we can check that it did work because what we they expect we want to be found here is not found right
00:08:38 believe it or not that is the server nearly built actually so we need to go to a website I will show you that that
00:08:44 is this website here when you come on here so password generated. net I'll go put that on there you need to go to the
00:08:50 old version the reason we can't go into the old version is because you can't create a 64 character password so I
00:08:57 wanted to go to the old version I'll put that link here and basically we are going to
00:09:04 create two passwords the only thing we need to make sure is the first one is going to be 64 characters long and I'll
00:09:11 explain what these are going to be used for in a moment and make sure this little check box is enabled where it say
00:09:17 exclude special characters include this as well exclude these as well ambiguous
00:09:22 characters so make sure these two are checked as well and this should create a
00:09:28 a 24 64 character passwords but it has done so we're going to put that in a notepad and we will refer to that in a
00:09:34 moment that is our first password so I move that out the way and we need to do exactly the same again there but this
00:09:41 time just do 22 characters should be enough generate a password and these are going to be our two passwords that we're
00:09:47 going to be using in our server and client config okay and it's time we went to that now so open up a win SCP session
00:09:54 to your server and under alphes Auto you're going to see two files you're
00:10:00 going to see client config which we're going to cover a lot more detail you're going to see Server config so the first
00:10:05 thing we need to do we need to popul out the top two Fields here so this off
00:10:10 token is that 64 character password that we created here so this one here is
00:10:17 going to go in here the master host will be HTTP colon4 slash and the name of
00:10:26 your servers Alpha hyphen Auto server and it's Port 3000 so it's colon
00:10:33 3123 then we can save that and if we go into the server config the off token
00:10:39 needs to be put in there and then we need to specify a name this is the name you use when you log into your web page
00:10:45 for this and we're just going to call this one user and we're going to put in that 22 character password under here
00:10:52 where it say basic authentication you'll see that in action very soon and while I'm here I'm just going to change this
00:10:59 cuz I know just for the purpose of testing the recovery amount 644 but we'll we'll definitely cover that later
00:11:06 that is all we need the server is actually probably ready to go now now one final check we need to do is that we
00:11:12 need to make sure that the server can talk to itself and there's it can yep but it's always best always best to edit
00:11:18 a host
00:11:25 file yeah it didn't have it in there so I'm going to manually put it in there so so for me going to keep the loot back
00:11:30 address in there as well and I'm going to delete these files here you don't need these These are IPv6 addresses so
00:11:38 control and K can just delete all those lines now hopefully I am going to get rid of that
00:11:45 keep the Local Host as a loop back resolve into the right IP address now okay so we know that these can
00:11:51 definitely talk to each other so fingers cross this should work so if I went not
00:11:57 been restart server let me put these in instructions and if all going real if I
00:12:04 go into the server now screen dasr server it's running it is running right
00:12:10 we can test
00:12:17 this okay it's looking promising so we said the username was
00:12:22 user and the password is that 22 character password as I was talking about earlier so we come back to that
00:12:29 Bingo ladies and gentlemen is that's the that's it running you've built the server I suppose there's one other thing
00:12:35 we need to run if we come out of this screen and if we run the command bin SL restart get IP server
00:12:44 hopefully this works fine if we go into that
00:12:51 screen screen dashr get IPS Capital IP that's running as well that's not
00:12:57 relevant till later on but it's always best to have it running on a server all the time right if you got this far
00:13:03 congratulations you have just built your first alph server or may not be your first Al server this will be the first
00:13:09 alph server under alers Auto now that's the easy part now we're going to go on to the client we're going to go on the
00:13:15 client build now and this leads into the next section of the video so again this is a fresh install
00:13:21 of auntu server with just a very few slight amendments got rid of Firefox
00:13:26 replaced it with chromium added the plugins there for Tron link and a plugin
00:13:31 for Google authenticare and that's all I've done I've chose a a minimum install the desktop and it's got the
00:13:37 specification of this box is 2 gigs of RAM two virtual CPUs and 30 gigs of
00:13:44 storage shouldn't need anything more than that okay I've just run a putty session into the client username is user
00:13:52 password is password but um we're going to start for the process here so some of the bits are going to be very similar so
00:13:57 we're going to be doing all of this okay I know there was no updates I've done an
00:14:03 update an upgrade there's no updates so upgrades Supply we're going to install these
00:14:08 tools I added one more tool there was open SSH server so I put that in the
00:14:14 instructions like before we're going to install MVM and then we need to log out and log back in again MVM install node
00:14:21 use node clone out of us the desktop doesn't have get installed so I need to include
00:14:28 that okay okay get clone CD into alphav verse so here we rename the package file
00:14:34 which we're not going to do so we're going to continue with the rest of this so I want the L link bit to be pretty
00:14:39 quick you know this shouldn't take too long but be in mind this is going to be creating a template so we're not going to be doing too many client
00:14:46 configuration settings at the moment but we will set up the basics for everybody likewise we're going to make sure the B
00:14:52 scripts are executable just check
00:14:57 that fine going to globally install node packet manager okay and we're going to
00:15:04 globally install mpm check update so we can run the ncu dasu that is up to dat
00:15:10 and then mpm install then finally an update upgrade
00:15:17 just in case there's any upgrades right the next bit we need to make a modification to the client config before
00:15:23 we can continue so we can Nano the client config and what we need to do is we need
00:15:30 to put in there the sudo password because some of the best scripts won't one unless that's in there so mine is
00:15:38 password and we can add in here the API server because again some of the API
00:15:44 script so we know that's just the name of the surfer I called that Alpha hyphen
00:15:51 Auto hyphen server and I put my PSE sudo password in there so we're going to exit this and
00:15:59 save it and just to make sure we can ping that no we can't ping it so we're
00:16:04 going to have to modify the host
00:16:11 file yeah I'm going to get rid of all these entries apart from the local host for the loot back address so control and
00:16:19 K I'm going to add one entry for the
00:16:26 server now hopefully we should to pain the server which we can which is what we
00:16:32 want in the template when you're fully in production you want every client to be able to talk to the server but you
00:16:38 need the server to be able to talk to every client and that'll be around Administration where we're going to use SSH pass to do backups and things like
00:16:45 that so for the purpose of the template we only need to one add one entry if the
00:16:51 client can't talk to the server then yeah you're never going to get it running right now we got that we
00:16:56 technically should better run not being build agent and what this does it builds
00:17:02 out the electron proxy agent now we should better test this is working um
00:17:08 and I think this is a good um security very good sanity check for you so this command here node client verifier we'll
00:17:15 make sure that you're running against a GitHub repo that hasn't been played
00:17:20 around with guys yeah before you run with this guys so I've noticed there have been a few clones of alphav Versa I
00:17:26 have no idea what that code does do and you're dealing in crypted currency here you really should be careful okay yeah
00:17:33 don't use one of the Clones but to verify that you are running the right versions of the code I have built in a
00:17:39 checks and verification for you so I've taken the hash of all the essential files and this does a check against them
00:17:46 and if these any of these fail they come up red so make sure they're all green so when you R node client verifier that's
00:17:53 going to give you peace of mind guys KN knowing that you're running a legitimate version of alpe not some for talk with
00:17:59 some other code that I have no idea what it's doing I wouldn't trust anything else so if any of these are red it's got
00:18:07 alarm Bells stop come and talk to me I put that command in the instructions i'
00:18:12 say that's mandatory that you need to run that right we need to do one more thing with this uh template we need to
00:18:17 make sure when we go into here we go to Startup applications we remove whatever is here
00:18:25 and we're going to add in the alphav Auto bin folder and start alphav
00:18:33 agent. sh this one here you don't need to give it a name that means whenever we start it uh
00:18:42 it's always going to launch and we're going to make a couple of small
00:18:49 changes as well just to make life a little bit easier so the first one here
00:18:54 we're going to set it up so that when we go into settings right click on privacy and security and when it's got screen
00:19:00 lock because it's is just annoying turn off all of these so make sure the screen
00:19:06 is set to set to never never blank the screen and just turn off all of these okay because you're going to need that
00:19:12 and one final thing we need to do we need to make a change to this file here sudu Nano Etc gd3 custom.com because
00:19:20 we're going to set it to automatically log in when you tell me you start the machine okay and what I've done I've already set this one here but you need
00:19:26 to remove the hashes so that it's not not commented out so it's not blue it's white text Ena so it says automatic
00:19:33 login enable equals true and here you're going to specify your username from so
00:19:39 from me the automatic login users is going to be called user but it' be whatever you set Yours to and just exit
00:19:46 that now if all going well if we reboot
00:19:51 this this should automatically log in and it should automatically start the alphav agent right that work fine guys
00:19:59 so yeah I'm happy with that so obviously the agent failed because it's um I need a VPN and that leads nicely into the
00:20:06 next section because we're going to now going through the process of setting up
00:20:13 VPN okay obvious most of the commands here when working with vpns it's not that difficult I've done a lot of the
00:20:19 work for you already actually so if you I'm using Pia if if you don't have Pia
00:20:26 please use this link here because that give you a 30 day free trial it is an affiliate link but they don't pay me any
00:20:32 money what they do is they give me 30 days of free Pia access for everybody
00:20:38 that's every account that signs up you don't have to use that but I'd appreciate if you do but you do get a 30day free trial which is is worth it in
00:20:45 its own right right the first thing we're going to do is we're going to head on over to Discord and in the alpe
00:20:52 section under installation guides I have put this file called VPN doz
00:20:59 so you need to download that and unzip here in there there are it's the pre
00:21:04 compiled ciphers required to work with Pia and we're going to be using
00:21:09 openvpn so I've got Pia working with openvpn and I've modified all of the
00:21:15 ciphers and everything I've done all the hardware for you you can look at those so I've extracted folders here and in
00:21:22 here we've put all these different locations and if we look at one for example these are all defined with all
00:21:28 of the right ciphers required and I've chained in the intermediary I've chained
00:21:36 the certificates so they do work and I specified here that it will look for a file called past for the user
00:21:42 credentials which we're going to cover in a moment so I've done a lot of work for you so all you need to do really is
00:21:48 just take a copy of this folder and put it in the root folder of
00:21:56 your user okay so it's important it sits under
00:22:02 your root folder because when we run these the scripts to change VPN location
00:22:07 is exactly looking in at location so if we look under the Bim folder we look at the restart VPN
00:22:15 script you'll see it's using J Cube extracting information getting the pseudo password but it will take a
00:22:23 random location and it'll restart the VPN and it checks
00:22:29 if there's no duplicates that took me ages to put together guys ages bloody ages so the important thing is is yeah
00:22:35 we just simply got a folder called VPN it's case sensitive it has to be Capital VPN that's just the way I called it and
00:22:42 then we're going to go back over here so we're going to run through these commands here so I already have VPN and
00:22:48 I've already downloaded and uploaded the files for the VPN files as you saw me just do just now so we're going to run
00:22:55 through these
00:23:02 so we need some file to begin with so I'm going to be using France as an example and we are
00:23:10 copying the France ovpn file and we putting it at open vvpm
00:23:16 folder but we re renaming it to client.com because that's what I got specified in the ciphers and then we
00:23:24 need to create the file with the password so it's sudon n/c
00:23:29 open VPN and pass the name of the file will be called pass with no extensions and in
00:23:37 here you're going to put your Pia credentials so I'm going to put mine in so bear with me a sec right I've put my
00:23:43 Pia credentials in right I've put my Pia credentials in and we can continue this
00:23:48 should just work now so we are enabling the VPN service
00:23:57 we're going to reload the demon and then we should be able to just
00:24:03 start it and if this
00:24:09 works I should be able to run a c command to check what my IP address is I know my real IP address okay had one
00:24:17 more command there wasn't aware on this desktop there we go that is vpm working
00:24:26 that is not my public IP that's a VP address we're nearly at completion to
00:24:31 converting this into a template because we're going to deploy three clients from this template right I'm going to populate out the information here this
00:24:38 is that 64 character password we did
00:24:44 earlier this is used when Alpha verse talks when the client talks to the server creates a socket connection and
00:24:51 in that sock connection is embedded this off token so it's a level of security built with an alphav verse that's reason
00:24:59 why it's really long rended yeah yeah and if it doesn't have that off token in its communication back to the server it
00:25:05 gets rejected so never share that guys never share that Master host is
00:25:11 HTTP right I put in there the master host as well so it's HTTP name of the
00:25:17 server colum 3000 and we just need to finally popul at the server config
00:25:23 actually guys you don't need to do anything on the server config all you need to worry about is making sure that this is set right for me I know that's
00:25:30 644 the recover amount you don't need to De basic uh orth user or the basic of
00:25:37 password they're used by the server save that and I think we are ready to convert this to a template okay right in order
00:25:44 to convert this to a template we simply need to right click I'm going to get rid of the
00:25:50 instructions now guys I'm going to hide these going to right click this click on shutdown I'm just going to delete the
00:25:56 old template because we don't need that one any more and I'm going to convert this one to a
00:26:01 template right click convert to template now for me I just keep a note of what
00:26:07 Pia version which account I got because I got 15 Pia accounts so for me this is
00:26:14 account 15 so I'll have a template for every single pa account because I've got a
00:26:20 different username and password in the past file okay so what I'm going to do now
00:26:27 I'm going to deploy three images from this as you can see guys as as I deploy them I just put a note in the
00:26:33 description which PA Pia account I'm using just for ease of administration so
00:26:39 if I need to redeploy it I know which version of the Pia client to use I'll do the other two actually after I have to
00:26:44 do them one at a time guys because they're going to end up with IP conflicts if I don't but I have made it
00:26:50 pretty easy now using the desktop version changing IPS is no longer a
00:26:55 problem I'm going to show you how easy it is now so I'm going to add these to my host file so this one is going to
00:27:01 have an IP address of 10503 right on because we're using the
00:27:07 desktop version it's very easy to change the IP now so if you click on up here click up here come down to
00:27:15 wired click on wired settings and then click this little gear Cog here and we
00:27:22 have the option to change it manually see we can disable IPv6 from
00:27:28 here here that's a pain in the ass normally we can sell it to manual and we said
00:27:40 50.3 okay that worked fine I was able to Ping by the host name so I'm going to deploy the other two and I will bring
00:27:45 you back right that did not take very long until guys so I deployed three clients from here they've all got the
00:27:51 right IP address now and I can ping them all fine and this is going to lead next nicely into the next section next
00:27:57 section is about how we configure the client config and all of the settings in there we're getting very close guys
00:28:03 getting very very close so we're going to go through the first two steps here so it says here
00:28:09 sign up to trong grid which is trong grid. and create a wallet uh TRX wallet
00:28:15 using Tron link so we just go through those now so Tron grid is going to give
00:28:20 us the API key okay so you have to sign up okay once you created your account
00:28:26 you need to verify it okay once you get get successful registration it's really stra straightforward here you don't need
00:28:31 to link any wallet address click on Skip and all we're going to do here is go to API keys and create an API key I just
00:28:38 create an API C Al of us once you've done that just click on this button here where it says check and that will give
00:28:45 you the API key there and that's going to give you our first key bit of information which is the API key that's
00:28:51 going to go into the config so that is going to go this one here where it says Tron API key that's the information
00:28:58 there so we're going to put that in a text file but now we've done that all we need to do is go to the next section
00:29:04 which is said sign up to it says create a wallet TR we're on Tron link.org and
00:29:09 what we're going to do is click on install now extension Chrome web
00:29:16 store and we're going to add it to Chrome so once that's been installed all we need to do is just create a wallet
00:29:22 okay now we have a wallet so we have the second key piece of information so when you click on here just click on receive
00:29:29 we have got the wallet address so that's going to be your shared wallet and that is going to go here the withdrawal
00:29:35 address so we so far we've got the Tron API key and we've got the withdraw address so the only two other bits of
00:29:40 information we need is the private key and I'll show you how to get that and the deposit address is going to be the
00:29:47 address that we get it's going to be individual per account that we will get from stake so I'll show you how to get
00:29:53 the private key so when you click on your wallet go back to the main page click on these three dots here and click
00:30:01 on export account and one of the option will be the private key so we're going to make a note of that okay now that
00:30:08 I've got the private key and that private key obviously is going to go here which this private key and the last
00:30:16 thing we need to get for this particular account you know what I would do I would
00:30:21 uh I will put this in my template so you don't have to do it every single time
00:30:27 like the withdrawal would be the same the private key would be the same and the API key would be the same the only
00:30:32 thing that would be unique is the deposit address for every single account now the top deposit address will be when
00:30:39 we go into stake and we go to wallet and we click on deposit and there's our deposit address and that's the fourth
00:30:46 and final piece of information that we need for to complete our section on the
00:30:51 wallet configuration right the next sections are just going to be the information that you're going to get from the casino so your account username
00:30:58 and you can't password you should know quite easily how to get we've set the
00:31:04 currency to TRX now the the only bit that you probably need to know one is how to get
00:31:10 your API key which is which is the easiest so settings API and you can click on reveal
00:31:17 and you'll get your API address and that's going to be unique per account now to get the two Factor secret it's
00:31:23 slightly more tricky when you go to security when you're enabled two Factor authentification you'll be shown just
00:31:31 once and only once the two Factor secret now if you've already got two
00:31:37 Factor enabled and you don't have your two Factor secret you'll have to disable two two factor and then reenable it and
00:31:45 it will show you on that one instance the two Factor secret and that is all we
00:31:51 need and that will populate the entire config so we've got the username API key
00:31:56 the stake account password the two Factor secret we've got the withdraw common withdrawal address we've got the
00:32:03 deposit address which we've got the private key and we've got the TR API
00:32:08 key that is all you need it's not that difficult but if you do get stuck just reach out to me or the community there
00:32:15 plenty of people that will help you so if it isn't obvious at the moment it's set up in a way that you we have one
00:32:21 wallet address shared across all accounts well early on we created three new machines for the template so these
00:32:29 three accounts here I have already populated out the the config the client
00:32:34 config so I've got all of the correct details in there so what I'm going to do I'm just going to copy those over to
00:32:40 this machine each of these machines and we should be almost ready to go this should just work okay as's an example
00:32:46 I've done the first one so I've got the off token I've got the master host which is Alpha server Auto I've got the
00:32:53 username I've got the API key I've got the password I've got the two two Factor secret I've got the currency defined as
00:33:00 TRX I've got the bus threshold defined on a version 8 of back code is 20.5 with
00:33:07 an 85 start balance I've got the recovery threshold set is 85 so that's a start balance I've got the sudu password
00:33:15 in this instance the password is password because you know what it is this is will all be deleted by the time
00:33:20 you see this video we're not running in simulation mode so we can ignore the simulation settings we set the API
00:33:26 server to Alpha Auto server I've got the withdrawal address which is the shared
00:33:33 tox wallet I've got the deposit address which is unique to this account I've got the private key which came from the Tron
00:33:40 link.org wallet when I exported the private key and I've got the Tron grid.
00:33:47 API key so I can save that and I just need to do the same for the remaining accounts and I'll be right back okay
00:33:53 we're getting close to the end of this video now I've successfully deployed the three clients that they are running fine
00:33:58 I've tested them they're all working fine nothing is wrong right I'm going to pause
00:34:05 this and it's going to lead me into the final chapter of this
00:34:11 video one of the most common questions I can see within Discord that people that want to deploy alpe is the question
00:34:20 where are they're going to run it what infrastructure what did I use a VPS how you going to do it so
00:34:27 technically there's nothing stop if you wanted to test alphav verse today you could go off and you could provid you
00:34:32 got a reasonable respect for PC you could install auntu the server and a
00:34:38 desktop on Virtual box so you can use Virtual box now I use Virtual box in my
00:34:44 local machine but not for running Alpha verse but I think it's a really good way of just testing ideas yeah it's quite
00:34:53 easy to download install virtual box and I'm not going to go through it this video but it may be a really good option
00:34:59 for you to to try and test alpe so you can follow these steps and
00:35:05 install auntu server on Virtual box locally and obviously depending on the specification of the machine the number
00:35:12 of virtual box instances that you could run on there now if you're going to get serious about this now you could run on
00:35:19 a VPS and there are plenty of VPS providers out there uh but it's going to
00:35:24 cost you money always think the best installation and I think probably more secure installation of of um alph ver if
00:35:31 you run it on your own equipment you know and there are some real amazing Bargains out there and I'm just going to
00:35:37 point out a couple of these to you now I'm running off equipment like this it's
00:35:42 older generation HP servers gen 9 gen 9 HP servers with 128 gigs of RAM should
00:35:51 comfortably get you 50 virtual Machines of one box and if you can pick those up
00:35:56 for like $130 around that sort of price I mean what an absolute steal so you don't need
00:36:03 to spend a great deal you know this it's amazing amount of uh Hardware that you
00:36:09 can get for such little money today because nobody wants these anymore they're end of life but these come with two CPUs typically with 12 sometimes 16
00:36:18 core CPUs with hyperthreading enabled that's a lot of CPU cores that you get
00:36:24 to play with and 128 gigs of RAM you're only going to allocate 2 gam per
00:36:30 virtual machine you can get an awful lot of virtual machines off one of these boxes and that's is exactly how I run my
00:36:37 Al of us just look for eBay HP gen 9 128
00:36:43 gig shocks me I'm not joking to you guys I used to buy these when these first came out new and I was paying over
00:36:49 £10,000 a server the fact that you could pick these up
00:36:55 for1 unbelievable unbelievable and that is a lot of horsepower for that way more than you're
00:37:02 going to get off a desktop PC you don't need GPU or anything like that you just need CPU and memory now the next
00:37:09 question if you're going to run bu your own equipment is uh you know you don't have to run Citrix n server you could
00:37:16 run alternative hypervisors Citrix n server is not free
00:37:22 but to be honest with you zri Zen server came from Zen source from Oxford
00:37:28 University I've been up to meet those guys it's a spin-off and those and that is still available and that's pretty
00:37:35 much identical to Citrix Zen server Zen server Citrix has been optimized to run Citrix virtual desktops
00:37:41 and bit spe got other features that Zen Source won't have but we don't need any of those features anyway so that may
00:37:48 well be a very good alternative another really good alternative is XP
00:37:56 xcp-ng I could tell there's literally these again it's almost identical to
00:38:03 Citrix Zen server as well it's the same Zen Source base code because Zen source
00:38:09 is open source you see and these are all free these are all free and the third
00:38:14 and final one is proxmox is another really good alternative as well proxmox
00:38:21 could be used as an alternative to Citrix Zen server if I was building from
00:38:26 scratch I will probably use proxmox or
00:38:32 xpg it still missed me that you can buy so much compute resource for such little
00:38:38 money I think that is the most costeffective way of running Alpha verse dabble with it play with it get it
00:38:44 working locally machine use Virtual box once you're comfortable with it and you've got the right strategy and you're
00:38:51 comfortable with that strategy go off and buy a server or something you don't have to buy these rackmount servers they
00:38:57 do something called an ml range and they basically look like full tower
00:39:03 workstations similar price similar specification and that may well be a better option as well well I hope that's
00:39:10 giving you food for thought and also hope this video has been useful to you cuz please recognize it's huge amount of
00:39:16 work for me to put this video together now I put all these links in the description as well there will be a PDF document that you can download with this
00:39:22 as well it's going to have all the commands in it and obviously it's going to be up and get up as well and if you
00:39:27 get any problems at all guys you know just reach out to me in Discord I will do my damnest to help you okay I think
00:39:33 that was comprehensive enough if I've missed anything let me know but if not
00:39:39 good luck and I'll speak you all again very very soon [Music]
00:39:57 oh
